# ApproveForAllWithSignature Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `ApproveForAllWithSignature` contract and its functionality.

## Implementation

The `ApproveForAllWithSignature` contract extends the functionality of the ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-20 token standards. It uses the OpenZeppelin Contracts library for the base implementation of the token standards and additional features such as role-based access control, pausability, and upgradeability.

The contract introduces a new `approveForAllWithSignature` function, which allows token owners to approve or revoke the approval of an operator to manage their tokens using a signed message.

## Contract Functions

### approveForAllWithSignature

This function allows token owners to approve or revoke the approval of an operator to manage their tokens using a signed message. It takes the following parameters:

- `_owner`: The address of the token owner
- `_operator`: The address of the operator to be approved or disapproved
- `_approved`: A boolean value indicating whether the operator is approved (true) or disapproved (false)
- `_nonce`: The nonce for the token owner
- `_signature`: The signed message from the token owner

### getNonce

This function returns the nonce for a given token owner. It takes the following parameter:

- `_owner`: The address of the token owner

### pause

This function allows pausing the contract. Only users with the `PAUSER_ROLE` can call this function.

### unpause

This function allows unpausing the contract. Only users with the `PAUSER_ROLE` can call this function.

### _authorizeUpgrade

This function is used for upgrading the contract. Only users with the `UPGRADER_ROLE` can call this function.

## Security

This project has undergone multiple security reviews and improvements. However, it is crucial to perform your security audit before using the contract in production. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please report them to the repository maintainers.
